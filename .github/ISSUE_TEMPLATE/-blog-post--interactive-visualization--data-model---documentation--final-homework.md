# Doing
- [ ] Create a pull request at https://github.com/onefact/blog.datathinking.org with the blog template
  - [ ] ✍️ Write a draft of the blog post starting with your 🧘 experience report for the first class (or elements of it)
  - [ ] 💽 + 🤔 Describe the research question from the previous homework that you have edited with feedback from the class 
  - [ ] 🧐💰 Describe the stakes of the research question -- who has skin in the game? Who bears material consequences if decisions are made one way or another? What systems are involved or have power?
  - [ ] 💽 + 🤔 Describe the context of the data (what was included or excluded and why, or what is unknown about the provenance or governance of the data or models or systems involved), and create a diagram in Figma to document this (export diagram in svg format)
  - [ ] 📐💄 Write the mathematics for the model and visualization you choose to use (write the mathematics in LaTeX) 
  - [ ] 💽 + 🤔 Assess the analysis you have done: did you answer the research question you sought to answer? 
  - [ ] 💽 + 🤔 Reflect on the 🧘 social, emotional, technical, legal (?) journeys that were par for the course of this data thinking endeavor.
  - [ ] 📈 Include the interactive Altair visualization following the principles from the Visualization guest lecture in the blog post. 
  - [ ] 📓 Include code snippets in `python`, `SQL` (`duckdb`) necessary to download the data, standardize it, analyze it, visualize it.
  - [ ] 💬 Include all the ways in which you used (or decided not to use) a large language model to help you complete these steps, and add a https://gist.github.com/ public gist link documenting the prompts and responses you used along the way.
  - [ ] 💻 Include a link to the repository needed to replicate this blog post and visualization using the code snippets.
- [ ] 💻 Create a pull request at https://github.com/onefact/data.datathinking.org with the code necessary to standardize + document the dataset you use for the blog
