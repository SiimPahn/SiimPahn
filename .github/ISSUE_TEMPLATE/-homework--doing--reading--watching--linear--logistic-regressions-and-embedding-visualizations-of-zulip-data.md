## Doing
- [ ] Clean Data Thinking Zulip chat data, located at https://github.com/onefact/datathinking.org-codespace/blob/main/data/datathinking.zulipchat.com/raw/messages-000001.json - put it in a `polars` dataframe and compute summary statistics of the dataset
- [ ] Analyze this Zulip chat data using logistic regression, linear regression, and embeddings with the tools we have learned in the lectures (don't forget to ask ChatGPT, Claude, Lex, GPT-4 for help as much as you need, and ask for help on the Data Thinking Zulip chat :)
- [ ] Create a visualization of logistic regression of the Data Thinking Zulip chat data
- [ ] Create a visualization of linear regression applied to the Data Thinking Zulip chat data 
- [ ] Create a visualization of embeddings using the Data Thinking Zulip Chat data
- [ ] Make a copy of the Overleaf template: https://www.overleaf.com/read/ghpyzqwqwxpv (need to create an account and/or sign in if this is your first time using Overleaf). To make a copy, open the project after signing in using this link, and click on `Menu`, then `Copy Project`:

- [ ] In Overleaf, edit the template and figure out how to include a PDF figure in the report, alongside a brief description (a few sentences or paragraphs is fine!) of each of the analyses you performed, why you chose them, and the math equation for the linear regression, logistic regression, and embedding you used.
- [ ] Add the PDF of the report to this issue as a comment.
- [ ] Send a message on Zulip with a link to this comment, alongside the image representing your favorite visualization

## Reviewing
