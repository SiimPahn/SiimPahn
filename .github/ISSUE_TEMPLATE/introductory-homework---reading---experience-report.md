# Asking
- [ ] Ask ChatGPT for help completing this homework

# Feeling, Writing, Thinking
- [ ] Post an experience report (a paragraph or several) as a comment on this issue. This experience report should convey what motivates you to understand and practice data thinking. An experience report may describe a collection of experiences (which may or may not relate to data), and some questions to consider may be helpful: What were you or those involved feeling? Doing? Thinking? Asking? Where were they? What systems were involved, if any? Who would you want to better understand the incentives at play?
  - if you are stuck, ask for help on Zulip, come to office hours, make a plan of tasks to do and ask for feedback on the plan
  - try using dictation on iPhone, Android, computer, and ask ChatGPT to summarize it
  - ask Lex for ideas or ChatGPT for ideas
  - edit using https://hemingwayapp.com/, Grammarly, or any other tool to help
  - read the below articles for ideas

# Doing
- [ ] Review the first class: https://panopto.ut.ee/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=43bb180c-79a6-4324-b055-afa400ecd1a0 - ask on Zulip if you can't access this

- [ ] Create a LinkedIn profile. (If you are not comfortable using your real name, feel free to use a fake name + email)
- [ ] Post your LinkedIn profile on Zulip -- Zulip is open source and enables us to analyze our chat messages with natural language processing tools such as ChatGPT, which we will do later in the course!
- [ ] Read https://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-email/ to understand principles of communication over email or Zulip
- [ ] Read parts of the Mailchimp Style Guide (https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/voice-and-tone/ or https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/writing-principles/) to understand how written communication can be guided by principles
- [ ] Read https://georgesaunders.substack.com/p/on-worry to understand a professional writer's perspective on writing.
- [ ] Read https://every.to/chain-of-thought/writing-essays-with-ai-a-guide to understand how to use voice recording, dictation on your smartphone or computer, and ChatGPT, and Lex to help you write

- [ ] Read http://web.archive.org/web/20170208134519/http://storyshots.tumblr.com/post/25032057278/22-storybasics-ive-picked-up-in-my-time-at-pixar -- especially the "Once upon a time" story telling framework Pixar used for its movies.
- [ ] Read https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/02/13/the-dubious-rise-of-impostor-syndrome to help understand concepts that can increase our psychological safety and trust in class and how asking ChatGPT can help reduce our fear of asking for help when stuck.

# Programming & Infrastructure
- [ ] Create a GitHub Codespace using the data thinking template [here](https://github.com/codespaces/new?machine=standardLinux32gb&repo=603826598&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdevcontainer.json) (from https://github.com/onefact/datathinking.org-codespace)
- [ ] Send a screenshot to Zulip of a plot you made in the GitHub codespace (of any dataset or data you generated as in the live coding demo from the first lecture; ask for help if this is unclear)
- [ ] Sign up for Lex - message Jaan on Zulip for an invite code
- [ ] Sign up for Figma as a student (https://www.figma.com/education/students/)
- [ ] Install `copyq` on Windows Powershell or Linux using Chocolatey, or install Maccy on Mac using Homebrew. This will save you a lot of time throughout the class as you copy and paste things from ChatGPT!
